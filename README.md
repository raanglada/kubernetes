# Kops and kubeconfig
- after you installed your cluster with kops you can use the kube config file generated to enter to the cluster from another point
- to manage the cluste from another machine you need:
    - the yaml config file generated by default in ~/.kube/config
    - the name of the cluster and the name of the bucket were kops stored the state of the cluster
```
bucket_name=bucket-for-kops-2
cluster_name=test.k8s.local
```
- - se the corresponding environment variables, examples:
```
export KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME=$cluster_name
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://${bucket_name}
```
- use the script set-local-kubectl-config.sh to set locally the access to the k8s cluster with kubectl
```
$ . set-local-kubectl-config.sh
```
